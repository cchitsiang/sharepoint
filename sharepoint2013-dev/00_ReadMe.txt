# Introduction
This is a set of scripts for automatically setting up different stages of development environments based on Windows Server 2012 using powershell.

The scripts are separated into 3 stages 01, 02 and 03:
- 01 is the basic server setup setting the computer name, configuring the network (optional) and setting up the AD role
- 02 is installation and setup of SQL Server 2012
- 03 is the installation of visual studio 2013 and sharepoint 2013 (using AutoSPInstaller)
